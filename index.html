<h1>REDDER</h1>
<div class="subtitle">A lyrical essay on love, life, faith, and becoming</div>

<h2>I Am Love</h2>
<p>I am love. I am life, and you need to understand that.</p>

<p>I am organised. No condition falls apart, and I am working to get my rewards — to establish my life. I am not here to throw away what I have because it is your fault. My brain and heart are bound together, because it really doesn’t matter what’s out there, what’s outside. I shall keep inner peace first, then get my rewards. Life is long. That’s the perspective I need to see — until I can. I may count, and you are going to die. This is fear, the only one anyone should ever have.</p>

<p>I give you no choice other than to come back and swing on high, high vibes, hike — like I can see through. I cannot see anything other than pure love. If you lost it, come back and give me a hug, ZzZzZz — this is how I prefer and feel you best.</p>

<i><p>I know your idea of becoming alive — like allowing the noble to cut me out. Aware, it’s about mutual respect; give me a hand, and let’s land at seventeen.</p></i>

<h2>Stagnation</h2>
<p>Ten years back, you had a standard of life at a certain level — as did many others. Time went by to today’s day: you make double the money you used to, but your standard of life remains at the same level. Maybe this gives you a more mature sense of the whole picture.</p>

<p>I live with no regret. What may the one think who hasn’t made progress from the old days? He can barely afford to exist. But I still sense a bitter taste, thinking my progress wasn’t bright enough to spark the flame — the flame of freedom — from the place that I came from.</p>

<h2>Flow</h2>
<p>I can tell you that I flow. I flow through Rzzz.</p>
<p>Or maybe there is an idea for a question, a half-statement perhaps:</p>

<div class="quote">
<br>THERE IS NO GOD.<br>
GOD IS DEAD, world.Cubicone <br><br>
</div>

<p>Somewhat misunderstood, yet I still have a choice. I am hearing it — bam — in place, to solve the riddle.</p>

<h2>Twenty-Two</h2>
<p class="center"><strong>22</strong></p>

<p>If it isn’t the mission that brought us here, then there is no team. Slave locked in place and doesnt knoq how to heal deadnesss.</p>

<p>They do not know! Medicine doesn’t make us equal! Love of science — the beauty. Mind has created love. For love it is paid for, in the world ruled by two sinners, two cheaters. Guss what I believe in coming back as a child, and Noone ever was, at — we were where! where.</p>

<h2>Faith</h2>
<p>All my life, I felt you were not there, but that is the past now, friends.</p>

<p>I fell in love! With myself a long time ago! Even before I have died, sided cunt.</p>

<p>You probably figured. The grandchild — and I let myself die, cunt. Two sinners.</p>

<p>Was this my fault?</p>

<p><strong>My name was lost and found, it was all along the Faith.</strong></p>

<h2>The Past</h2>
<p>I came back as a grandchild. You probably got that already :-D That was the time when we turned sides. I decided to live your world, eat your pride, and lift you up. Short-sighted eyesight comes with age. The beauty of creation. Of human beings living.</p>

<p>Fake world spinning, and it ain’t mine.</p>

<h2>Female</h2>
<p>Female — I ain’t seeing it for you, the father. The other man. Wait. Let me think. Thinking of double Tap Two, uuuiiii hi. The knowledge is gold and pretty — pretty dark as blacks. Split shadow rising white, facing me alive, living the life.</p>

<h2>The Journey</h2>
<p>The life from the UK, through downtown LA, to Shanghai and back is on track. To the place where I am not looking for you. Off course.</p>

<p>Just do me a five and come back HOME. The time is yours — only one caveat to that: please remember. It comes from home.</p>

<h2>No Second Shot</h2>
<p>I do not think you have a second shot.</p>

<h2>Red</h2>
<p>The punchline for red:</p>
<p>I think you have cheated on me already.</p>
<p>Just f**k off already! You ain’t having it? :-P</p>
<p>That’s probably my man!</p>

<h2>Awakening</h2>
<p>Fun, right? I assume this message reaches all SAINTS! Right? Hehehe. Aa 😉 aj ajt hi! Streets on the supply.</p>
<p>This is actually the time we all shall be alive. Like, to think I cut you slug, mind-fucked wont step in dirt. Taking breath. I believe there is main reason for living to die LOVE. Deep in, I love ya. Yep, on the path to One: twice, trice, xxxx Coursescotoma at the same time. Non-violently. Drops, Greys have it — did you think before you spoke to protect the Off Dirt? </p>

 <h2>The Soul</scotoma
<p>The knowledge in depth makes you understand that female has a true pure soul. She’s the date-date. It’s easy, Beee. ONE..</p>

<p>More one. ONE.</p>

<p>I share smiles all over the canvas. This all is a wonderful joke full of smoke. The tied and wise man do not step out of the place that has a name, and it’s home.</p>

PEACE<br>
